Engineering Systems Optimization

**Overview**
Introduction to systems-oriented engineering design optimization. Emphasis on:
i) understanding and representing engineering systems and their structure, 
ii) obtaining, developing, and managing adequate computational (physics- and data-based) models for their analysis, 
iii) constructing appropriate design models for their synthesis,  
iv) applying suitable algorithms for their numerical optimization while accounting for systems integration issues. 

Advanced topics such as coordination of distributed problems and non-deterministic design optimization methods.
